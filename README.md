# Swish: Private Social Sharing Platform for Campus Communities.

### Overview 

Swish is a full-stack web application designed to bring the energy of social media into a secure, 
campus-exclusive environment. The platform allows students and faculty to share photos, 
updates, and achievements within their academic network. It mirrors the fast, visual, and 
engaging experience of modern social apps while ensuring privacy and moderation suitable for 
institutional use.
The goal is to create a vibrant digital space that celebrates campus life - where every post, 
comment, and like connects people within the same community.
